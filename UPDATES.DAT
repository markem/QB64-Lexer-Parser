Made it so all command return a value.

Modified the main program so it now has a loop which is
executed until the end of the input file.  Every time
something is found it is returned along with its ENUM.
The ENUM number is then printed out.

This is the first actual release of the software to the
QB64 community. (In a manner of speaking.  Maybe I should
say the first official release? Oh well, 99 years from
now no one will even remember me or think or care about
it so I'm not going to worry about it now.)


In this release I have put in the &B###, &O####, and &H####
commands.  I also had to put in something to define a
binary, octal, and hex variable (well, I already had
xdigit so I used that instead of creating a new define actually).
I tested this by putting in the following:

    a = &b012345    which gave variable, equal sign, binary number, integer number (2345)
    a = &o1234567890 which gave variable, equal sign, octal number, integer number (89)
    a = &h0123456789abcdefghijk which gave variable, equal sign, hexadecimal number, and standard variable (ghijk)

So those are working.

I also changed the string that looks for a float to just
use {float} because that already had the definition of a
float in it.

I also changed the string that looks for integer numbers
to just use {digit}+ because digit was already defined.

I also changed the PHP program (CMDS.PHP) so it auto
populates BAS.L with what it creates (rather than I do it
by hand) and also replaces the TEST.BAS file with the new
TEST.BAS information.  I got tired of doing it by hand.
There are two new lines BEFORE the lex code.  One says "DO
NOT REMOVE" the next line which says "BEGIN LEX" and two
lines after the lex code that says "END LEX" and another
"DO NOT REMOVE" comment.  The PHP script now looks for the
BEGIN and END tags, yanks out whatever is between them,
and replaces it with the new set of commands.  So DO NOT
put anything in between those two tags unless you just
like to have things deleted without notice.

Removed the LEX.DAT file and the TEST.DAT file since they
are no longer needed.
